Have admin create an OpenVPN server to be able to connect to servers on non-secure
networks like public shops

Also allows us to create clients to distribute to people to be able to do the same.

This may be a reason to work on the personal electron OpenVPN app on weekends so
we can easily distribute the client much like HW's Cisco vpn app but be able
to work for multiple operating systems.
